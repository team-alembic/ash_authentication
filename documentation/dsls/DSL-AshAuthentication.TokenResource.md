# DSL: AshAuthentication.TokenResource

This is an Ash resource extension which generates the default token resource.

The token resource is used to store information about tokens that should not
be shared with the end user.  It does not actually contain any tokens.

For example:

  * When an authentication token has been revoked
  * When a confirmation token has changes to apply

## Storage

The information stored in this resource is essentially ephemeral - all tokens
have an expiry date, so it doesn't make sense to keep them after that time has
passed.  However, if you have any tokens with very long expiry times then we
suggest you store this resource in a resilient data-layer such as Postgres.

## Usage

There is no need to define any attributes or actions (although you can if you
want).  The extension will wire up everything that's needed for the token
system to function.

```
defmodule MyApp.Accounts.Token do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer,
    extensions: [AshAuthentication.TokenResource],
    domain: MyApp.Accounts

  postgres do
    table "tokens"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end
end
```

Whilst it is possible to have multiple token resources, there is no need to do
so.

## Removing expired records

Once a token has expired there's no point in keeping the information it refers
to, so expired tokens can be automatically removed by adding the
`AshAuthentication.Supervisor` to your application supervision tree.  This
will start the `AshAuthentication.TokenResource.Expunger` `GenServer` which
periodically scans and removes any expired records.
