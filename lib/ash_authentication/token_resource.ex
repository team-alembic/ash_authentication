  @moduledoc """
  This is an Ash resource extension which generates the default token resource.

  The token resource is used to store information about tokens that should not
  be shared with the end user.  It does not actually contain any tokens.

  For example:

    * When an authentication token has been revoked
    * When a confirmation token has changes to apply

  ## Storage

  The information stored in this resource is essentially ephemeral - all tokens
  have an expiry date, so it doesn't make sense to keep them after that time has
  passed.  However, if you have any tokens with very long expiry times then we
  suggest you store this resource in a resilient data-layer such as Postgres.

  ## Usage

  There is no need to define any attributes or actions (although you can if you
  want).  The extension will wire up everything that's needed for the token
  system to function.

  ```
  defmodule MyApp.Accounts.Token do
    use Ash.Resource,
      data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer,
      extensions: [AshAuthentication.TokenResource]

    token do
      api MyApp.Accounts
    end

    postgres do
      table "tokens"
      repo MyApp.Repo
    end
  end
  ```

  Whilst it is possible to have multiple token resources, there is no need to do
  so.

  ## Removing expired records

  Once a token has expired there's no point in keeping the information it refers
  to, so expired tokens can be automatically removed by adding the
  `AshAuthentication.Supervisor` to your application supervision tree.  This
  will start the `AshAuthentication.TokenResource.Expunger` `GenServer` which
  periodically scans and removes any expired records.
