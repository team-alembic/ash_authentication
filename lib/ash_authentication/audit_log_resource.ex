  @moduledoc """
  This is an Ash resource extension which generates the default audit log resource.

  The audit log resource is used to store user interactions with the authentication system in order to derive extra security behaviour from this information.

  ## Storage

  The information stored in this resource is essentially time-series, and should be stored in a resilient data-layer such as postgres.

  ## Usage

  There is no need to define any attributes of actions (thought you can if you want). The extension will wire up everything that's needed for the audit log to function.

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Accounts.AuditLog do
    use Ash.Resource,
      data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer,
      extensions: [AshAuthentication.AuditLogResource],
      domain: MyApp.Accounts


    postgres do
      table "account_audit_log"
      repo MyApp.Repo
    end
  end
  ```

  Whilst it is possible to have multiple audit log resources, there is no need to do so.

  ## Batched writes

  In order to reduce the write load on the database writes to the audit log (via the `AuditLogResource.log_activity/2` function) will be buffered in a GenServer and written in batches.

  Batching can be disabled entirely by setting `audit_log.write_batching.enabled?` to `false`.
  By default it write a batch every 100 records or every 10 seconds, whichever happens first. This can also be controlled by options in the `audit_log.write_batching` DSL.

  ## Removing old records

  When the `log_lifetime` DSL option is set to a positive integer then log entries will be automatically removed after that many days.  To disable this behaviour, or to manage it manually set it to `:infinity`.  Defaults to 90 days.
