  Strategy for authenticating using an API key.

  ## Security Considerations

  Responsibility for generating, securing, expiring and revoking lies on the implementor.
  If you are using API keys, you *must* ensure that your policies and application are set
  up to prevent misuse of these keys. For example:

  ```elixir
  policy AshAuthentication.Checks.UsingApiKey do
    authorize_if action([:a, :list, :of, :allowed, :action, :names])
  end
  ```

  To detect that a user is signed in with an API key, you can see if
  `user.__metadata__[:using_api_key?]` is set. If they are signed
  in, then `user.__metadata__[:api_key]` will be set to the API key that they
  used, allowing you to write policies that depend on the permissions granted
  by the API key.
