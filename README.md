# AshAuthentication

AshAuthentication provides drop-in support for user authentication for users of
the [Ash framework](https://ash-hq.org).  It is designed to be highly
configurable, with sensible defaults covering the most common use-cases.

## Warning

This is **beta** software.  Please don't use it without talking to us!

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `ash_authentication` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ash_authentication, "~> 3.2.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

This package assumes that you have [Ash](https://ash-hq.org/) installed and
configured.  See the Ash documentation for details.

Once installed you can easily add support for authentication by adding the
`AshAuthentication` extension to your resource:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Accounts.User do
  use Ash.Resource,
    extensions: [AshAuthentication]

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    attribute :email, :ci_string, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :hashed_password, :string, allow_nil?: false, sensitive?: true
  end

  authentication do
    api MyApp.Accounts

    strategies do
      password :password do
        identity_field :email
        hashed_password_field :hashed_password
      end
    end
  end

  identities do
    identity :unique_email, [:email]
  end
end
```

If you plan on providing authentication via the web, then you will need to
define a plug using
[`AshAuthentication.Plug`](https://team-alembic.github.io/ash_authentication/AshAuthentication.Plug.html)
which builds a [`Plug.Router`](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Router.html) that
routes incoming authentication requests to the correct provider and provides
callbacks for you to manipulate the conn after success or failure.

If you're using AshAuthentication with Phoenix, then check out
[`ash_authentication_phoenix`](https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix)
which provides route helpers, a controller abstraction and LiveView components
for easy set up.

## Authentication Strategies

Currently supported strategies:

  1. [`AshAuthentication.Strategy.Password`](https://team-alembic.github.io/ash_authentication/AshAuthentication.Strategy.Password.html)
     - authenticate users against your local database using a unique identity
     (such as username or email address) and a password.
  2. [`AshAuthentication.Strategy.OAuth2`](https://team-alembic.github.io/ash_authentication/AshAuthentication.Strategy.OAuth2.html)
     - authenticate using local or remote [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)
     compatible services.
